# FruitSmart
Fruit classification by experimenting with several image processing techniques.

A few techniques were experimented with in developing a fruit classification algorithm based purely on image data. Raw numerical data 
was derived from images and fed into a Neural Network. Image extraction was done in MATLAB, training was completed in Java, and testing
was brought back to MATLAB to easily visualize performance. Techniques such as histograms of Red Blue and Green values were used, along 
with Hue, and lastly with Texture and a combination of these methods to boost performance. Range filtering and entropy filtering were
explored while experimenting with texture based processing. Highest performance results were achieved with the Hue and Texture based 
approach. The different classes of fruit were: Green apple, red apple, mango, orange, banana, watermelon, and an assortment of other 
random fruits to see training outcomes clearly.
